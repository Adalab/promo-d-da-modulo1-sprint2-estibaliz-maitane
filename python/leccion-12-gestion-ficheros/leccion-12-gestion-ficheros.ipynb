    "\n",
    "2. Cree una carpeta que se llame \"aprendiendo-ficheros\". ⚠️ Tened en cuenta que si la carpeta ya existe no la podemos crear, nos devolverá un error. Incluye en la función un programa que evite que nos de un error si la carpeta ya existe.\n",

    "    3. Para poder controlar los errores tendremos que usar un if loop, que si el fichero existe, nos devuelva un mensaje de que el fichero ya existe. En caso de que no exista, los deberéis crear y que la función nos muestre un mensaje de que se ha creado.\n",

Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).\n",

    "        to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas.
